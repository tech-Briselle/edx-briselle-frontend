## 📌 Project Overview

The Briselle frontend is built using **React.js** and integrates directly with **Supabase** for secure, scalable data storage and retrieval. It is hosted on [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com), removing the need for backend hosting infrastructure, and is ideal for lightweight, cost-efficient deployments.
